# FreeCodeCamp API Basejump # 3
## URL Shortener

This Basejump is third in a series of working with APIs in a full-stack environment that includes Node and Express.

It receives a user submitted URL and returns a considerably shorter string. When this shorter URL is enterered into the browswer, it will redirect to user's original.
